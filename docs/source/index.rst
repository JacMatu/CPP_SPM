This is a Matlab / Octave toolbox to perform MRI data analysis on a
`BIDS data set <https://bids.neuroimaging.io>`_ using SPM12.

Features
========

Preprocessing
-------------

If your data is fairly "typical" (for example whole brain coverage functonal
data with one associated anatomical scan for each subject), you might be better
off running `fmriprep <https://fmriprep.org/en/stable>`_ on your data.

If you have more exotic data that can't be handled well by fmriprep then CPP_SPM
has some automated workflows to perform amongst other things:

-   slice timing correction

-   fieldmaps processing and voxel displacement map creation (work in progress)

-   spatial preprocessing:

    -   realignment OR realignm and unwarp
    -   coregistration `func` to `anat`,
    -   `anat` segmentation and skull stripping
    -   (optional) normalization to SPM's MNI space

-   smoothing

All preprocessed outputs are saved as BIDS derivatives with BIDS compliant
filenames.

Statistics
----------

The model specification are done via the
`BIDS stats model <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bq5eNDHTb6Nkx3WUiOBgKvLNnaa5OMcGtD0AZ9yms2M/edit?usp=sharing)>`_
and can be used to perform:

-   whole GLM at the subject level
-   whole brain GLM at the group level Ã  la SPM (meaning using a summary
    statistics approach).
-   ROI based GLM

Quality control
---------------

-   anatomical data (work in progress to make it BIDS compatible)
-   functional data (work in progress to make it BIDS compatible)
-   GLM auto-correlation check

It can also prepare the data to run an MVPA analysis by running a GLM for each
subject on non-normalized images and get one beta image for each condition to be
used in the MVPA.


Assumptions
===========

At the moment this pipeline makes some assumptions:

-   it assumes that the dummy scans have been removed from the BIDS data set and
    it can jump straight into pre-processing,
