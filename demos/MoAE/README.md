# Mother of All Experiments

This "Mother of All Experiments" is based on the block design of SPM.

In the `options` folder has several examples of how to encode the options of
your analysis in a json file.

In the `models` shows the BIDS statistical model used to run the GLM of this
demo.

You can use the makefile to run all the main scripts with `make all`
